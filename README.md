# URL-shortener
This is a simple URL shortener web application that converts long URLs into shorter, shareable links. 
I've built using Express.js for the server, MongoDB for data storage, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features 
- Convert long URLs into short links
- Redirect users to the original URL when accessing the short link
